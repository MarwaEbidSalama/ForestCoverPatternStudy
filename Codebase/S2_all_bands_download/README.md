This script is written in Python and uses the Sentinel Hub API to acquire and process satellite imagery. The script is composed of several parts, each of which performs a specific function to achieve the overall goal of acquiring and processing satellite imagery.

The first part of the script imports the necessary libraries and sets the necessary configurations. The libraries used in this script are:

-sentinelhub: a library that provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with Sentinel Hub services.
-pandas: a library that provides data structures and data analysis tools.
-numpy: a library that provides functions for mathematical and array operations.

The script starts by creating an instance of the SHConfig class, which is used to set the configuration settings for Sentinel Hub services. Then, it checks if the necessary credentials (OAuth client ID and client secret) are present, and if not, it prints a warning message for more information check out the sentinelhub documentation ('https://sentinelhub-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configure.html').

The next part of the script defines a function get_all_bands_request(time_interval) that takes a time_interval as input and returns a SentinelHubRequest object with the specified parameters for image acquisition. This object contains all the necessary information to download an image from the Sentinel Hub, such as the bounding box, resolution, data collection, evalscript, output format and time_interval.

The script then creates a list of requests, one for each month between the start and end date specified earlier using a list comprehension. Each request is a call to the function get_all_bands_request(time_interval) with a specific time_interval.

Finally, it uses a for loop to iterate over the list of requests, download the image data for each request, and saving it to the specified data folder.
